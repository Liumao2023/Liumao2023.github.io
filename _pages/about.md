I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Stony Brook University, expected to graduate in Spring, 2025. 

Before coming to Stony Brook, I received my BA from Southwest University of Science and Technology, China, where I was advised by Professor Congmei Chen. I received my MA from Nanjing University where I study Pragmatics under the supervision of Professor Xinren Chen. You can find my current CV here.

My research interests include Syntax, Semantics and Chinese Linguistics. I am currently working on my dissertation, titled Derived (Dis-)possessive Predicates in Mandarin Chinese, advised by Professor Richard Larson. In this work, I investigate how a predicate becomes (dis-)possessive when a possessor externalizes. I offer syntactic and semantic evidence to argue that the possessive head has moved into the verbal domain, following the proposals by Freeze (1992) and Kayne (1993, 1994). 

In my non-academic life, I love playing soccer and badminton. I play soccer for over 20 years and you can find me play soccer in Sinatra Park Field, Resilliancy Park Field, and Sofive. I also love travelling and watching talent shows.
