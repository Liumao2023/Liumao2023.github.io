I am a Ph.D. candidate of Linguistics at Stony Brook University. My research interests include Syntax, Semantics and Chinese Linguistics. I am advised by Professor Richard Larson. Before coming to Stony Brook, I received my BA from Southwest University of Science and Technology, China, where I was advised by Professor Congmei Chen, and I received my MA from Nanjing University where I study Pragmatics under the supervision of Professor Xinren Chen. You can find my current CV here.

In my non-academic life, I love playing soccer and badminton. I play soccer for over 20 years and you can find me play soccer in Sinatra Park Field, Resilliancy Park Field, and Sofive. I also love travelling and watching talent shows.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
